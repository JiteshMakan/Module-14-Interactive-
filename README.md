üöÄ Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
1Ô∏è‚É£ Interactive Data Visualizations
Bar Chart
The bar chart displays the top 10 OTUs (bacterial cultures) for a selected test subject. The length of each bar is determined by the sample_values. The bars are labeled with the corresponding otu_ids, and hovering over a bar provides additional information from the otu_labels.

Bubble Chart
The bubble chart plots all OTUs for a selected sample, with the otu_ids on the x-axis and the sample_values on the y-axis. The size of each bubble represents the value of sample_values, while the color of the bubbles is determined by the otu_ids. When you hover over a bubble, you‚Äôll see more information from the otu_labels.

Metadata Panel
The metadata panel shows demographic information about the selected individual. It dynamically updates to reflect the selected individual whenever the user chooses a new option from the dropdown menu.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment & Submission
Once the dashboard is completed, host it using GitHub Pages. Ensure that all the visualizations update dynamically when different individuals are selected. Submit both the GitHub repository link and the live deployed page URL for review.
